## Tech I use

I use a Macbook Pro M3 Pro with macOS Sonoma.

My keyboard is a [36-key Corne with Kailh Choc Sunset switches](https://bsky.app/profile/andri.io/post/3ll2t3iks4k2g) that I built myself. At work I use a [ZSA Moonlander](https://www.zsa.io/moonlander) with 36 keys. My mouse is a Logitech MX Master 3.

I have Audio-Technica ATH-M50x headphones and PreSonus Eris E3.5 speakers that I
connect with a Focusrite Scarlett 2i2.

I use [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/) for development. I prefer [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) for new projects.
